/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for MediChain Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict ownership model for patient-related data, where only the patient (or authorized staff) can access their information.
 * Medication data is public read, with write access potentially restricted to pharmacy staff (not yet implemented).
 * Incident reports are primarily controlled by the reporter and authorized staff.
 * Doctor and Radiologist information is publicly available.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into top-level collections like `patients`, `medications`, `doctors`, `radiologists`, `staff`, and `incidentReports`.
 * Patient-specific data (prescriptions, appointments, lab orders, radiology orders, vital signs) are nested under the `/patients/{patientId}` path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing of patient subcollections (e.g., prescriptions, appointments) is restricted to the patient themselves.
 * - Medication data is publicly readable, but write access is not yet strictly controlled.
 * - Doctor and Radiologist data is publicly readable.
 * - Incident reports are writeable only by the staff member whose ID matches the reporterId, with no listing allowed for non-admins.
 * - Staff data is writeable only by HR/Admin staff (not yet implemented).
 * - All write operations require a valid authenticated user.
 * - Default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Prescription`, `Appointment`, `LabOrder`, `RadiologyOrder`, and `VitalSign` documents, which are nested under `/patients/{patientId}`, must have a `patientId` field that matches the `patientId` in the path. This is enforced on create and update to prevent unauthorized data linking.
 * - The `IncidentReport` document must have a `reporterId` field that matches the authenticated user's UID.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Patient-specific data is segregated under the `/patients/{patientId}` path to ensure privacy and controlled access.
